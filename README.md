# RISC-V Matrix Multiply Extension Demo

##  **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the concept of SAIL to CGEN translation by implementing a custom RISC-V matrix multiplication instruction extension. It showcases the complete pipeline from specification to implementation.

##  **What This Demonstrates**
- **Custom RISC-V Instruction Design**: `matmul` instruction for 2x2 matrix multiplication
- **SAIL-style Specification**: Formal specification language approach
- **CGEN-style Code Generation**: Automatic compiler integration
- **Complete Toolchain**: From specification to working implementation

##  **Project Structure**
```
risc-v-matrix-extension/
├── specs/              # SAIL-like specifications
├── cgen/              # CGEN-style descriptions
├── simulator/         # C-based instruction simulator
├── tests/             # Test cases and validation
├── tools/             # Build scripts and utilities
└── docs/              # Documentation and examples
```

##  **Technologies Used**
- **C** for simulator implementation
- **Make** for build system
- **Shell Scripts** for automation
- **RISC-V Assembly** for test cases
- **Formal Specification Languages**

##  **Build Instructions**
```bash
make all          # Build everything
make test         # Run test suite
make demo         # Run demonstration
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
```

##  **LFX Mentorship Relevance**
This project directly addresses the SAIL to CGEN mentorship goals:
1. **Automatic Translation**: Shows how to transform specifications into compiler descriptions
2. **Matrix Operations**: Focuses on tensor/matrix extensions as mentioned in the project
3. **RISC-V Extension**: Demonstrates practical instruction set extension
4. **Tool Integration**: Shows complete pipeline from spec to implementation

##  **Key Features**
- ✅ Custom RISC-V instruction format
- ✅ SAIL-inspired specification language
- ✅ CGEN-compatible output generation
- ✅ Working C simulator
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Documentation and examples

## 🤝 **Contributing**
This project serves as a proof-of-concept for the LFX SAIL to CGEN mentorship program.
