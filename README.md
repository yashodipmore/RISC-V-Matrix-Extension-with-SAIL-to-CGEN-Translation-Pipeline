# RISC-V Matrix Multiply Extension Demo

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the concept of SAIL to CGEN translation by implementing a custom RISC-V matrix multiplication instruction extension. It showcases the complete pipeline from specification to implementation.

## 🚀 **What This Demonstrates**
- **Custom RISC-V Instruction Design**: `matmul` instruction for 2x2 matrix multiplication
- **SAIL-style Specification**: Formal specification language approach
- **CGEN-style Code Generation**: Automatic compiler integration
- **Complete Toolchain**: From specification to working implementation

- **Make** for build system
- **Shell Scripts** for automation
- **RISC-V Assembly** for test cases
- **Formal Specification Languages**

## 🏗 **Build Instructions**
```bash
make all          # Build everything
make test         # Run test suite
make demo         # Run demonstration
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
```

## 🎯 **LFX Mentorship Relevance**
This project directly addresses the SAIL to CGEN mentorship goals:
1. **Automatic Translation**: Shows how to transform specifications into compiler descriptions
2. **Matrix Operations**: Focuses on tensor/matrix extensions as mentioned in the project
3. **RISC-V Extension**: Demonstrates practical instruction set extension
4. **Tool Integration**: Shows complete pipeline from spec to implementation

## 📝 **Key Features**
- ✅ Custom RISC-V instruction format
